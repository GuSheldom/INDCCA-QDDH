\chapter*{Abstract}
Formal verification plays a crucial role in validating the security and correctness of cryptographic constructions. However, complex reductions and game based proofs also make mechanized verification a challenge. 

This project represents formalization of the bilateral equivalence between the Indistinguishability under Non-Adaptive Chosen-Ciphertext Attack(\INDCCAone) security of Elgamal Key Encapsulation Mechanism(\KEM) and the q-determined Diffie-Hellman(\qDDH) assumption in the Algebraic Group Model(AGM). 

Using the EasyCrypt proof assistant, we formally prove both directions of this equivalence relation by mechanizing algebraic reasoning and oracle simulations and linear algebra operations. 

This thesis indicates the feasibility of machine-checked complex cryptographic proofs within the framework of an algebraic group model (AGM) and documents the technical methods and practical lessons I learned throughout the formalization process.
