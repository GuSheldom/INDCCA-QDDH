\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor, Dr. Thomas Haines, for his guidance during the early stages of this work. His support in providing the initial EasyCrypt framework and proof structure laid the foundation for the formalization developed in this thesis.
